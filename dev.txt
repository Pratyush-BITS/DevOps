This chapter is about stopping the blur, slowing down, and
actually experiencing the moments you want to savor and
remember rather than rushing through them just to get to that next
item on your to-do list. This idea is pretty simple, but we came
about it the hard way, by losing weeks and months of our own lives
to a whirling churn of busyness

From the very first moment I saw it—as a high school freshman
in 1992—I thought email was just about the coolest thing on
earth. Type a message, hit “Send,” and the words traveled at
the speed of light, immediately appearing on another computer—
no matter if it was down the street or halfway around the world.
Amazing!
